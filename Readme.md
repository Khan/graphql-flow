# flow-typed

The files in the `npm` directory are official library definitions which were
installed by running [flow-typed](https://github.com/flow-typed/flow-typed)
from the root directory.  If you make any customizations to an official
definition, please rename the file with the `_CONTAINS_KA_CUSTOMIZATIONS`
suffix and mark all customizations using `KA>`, `KA<` sentinel pairs.

The files in this directory are our own library definitions and in the case
of css.flow.js, document.js, and json.js, customizations of flow's own library
definitions.
